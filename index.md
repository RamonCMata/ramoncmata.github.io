	<h1>Amazing Axolotls</h1>
    <p>Not only are Axolotls cute they are absolutely incredible creatures! These <a href="https://www.massaudubon.org/learn/nature-wildlife/reptiles-amphibians/salamanders/about" target="_blank">salamanders</a> are only found in freshwater
	lakes & ponds <strong>exclusively</strong> in Mexico. With a lifespan up to <strong>15 years</strong>, they love to feast on worms, insects, small fish, and tadpoles. Their name means "water-dog", it comes from
	the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-americas/aztecs" target="_blank">ancient Aztecs</a> of Mexico who loved them! Unfortunely due to habitat distruction and pollution these unique animals are <strong>critically endangered</strong>.</p>
